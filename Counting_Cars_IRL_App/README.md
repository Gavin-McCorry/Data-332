# IRL Cars Analysis

## About üì∞
Radar speed signs track the speed which drivers are going to encourage safe driving practices, such as driving within the speed limit and keeping pedestrians safe. Many statitica; analysis of these signs have shown that drivers decrease their speeds wen radar speds are installed. Our goal in this project was to determine if these claims from the radar companies and other analysis of the technology are true.

For this project we hand collected data about the speed of the cars, in Miles Per Hour, the time of day the car was observed, the weather conditions, temperature, and day of the week.

## Data Collection

Describe how the car data was collected and any preprocessing steps performed.

## Code ‚úçÔ∏è
The shiny app template was obtained from the shinydashboard library.
```R
library(shinydashboard)
```

All the Code was simple and self-explanatory except for when displaying the times the data was collected on the graphs. With to many individual times, the graph was messy and hard to read. To do this we had to first change the format of the time data so that it could be displayed correctly, and so that R could skip the hours correctly. This was done using the as.POSIXct function.
```R
output$plot_01 <- renderPlot({
    if (input$X == "Time.of.Day") {
      # Convert input$X values to POSIXct datetime objects
      df$Time <- as.POSIXct(df$Time.of.Day, format = "%I:%M %p")
      
      ggplot(df, aes_string(x = df$Time, y = input$Y, colour = input$Splitby)) + 
        geom_point() +
        scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "1 hour", date_labels = "%I:%M %p")
      
    } else {
      ggplot(df, aes_string(x = input$X, y = input$Y, colour = input$Splitby)) + 
        geom_point() +
        labs(x = input$X, y = input$Y)
    }
  })
```

## Conclusion
Based on the 150 cars observed, we can find no initial correlation between the effectiveness of the radar and the speeds of cars. Besides the effectiveness of the radar, time of day, temperature, and weather don't have any correlation either with the speed of cars. More observations are needed to draw further conclusions about the effectiveness of speed radars on drivers speeding.
